This readme aims to introduce an initial documentation for collaboratory projects. Anyone working on the project can use, build and improve these repo. The next section will describe how this can be made.

For instructions on how to use some specific script present here, please navigate to the desired script's folder and check its corresponding **README.md** file.

## Contributing

To expand and keep adding value to this repo, instructions on how to add or modify a file will be described below.

### Adding a new script

To expand the available tools, a simple workflow will be defined based on oneFlow guidelines.

1. Add the script's folder to the root dir.
2. Make sure to add installation and usage instructions on a README.md file.
3. Provide the necessary libs or packages to run the script or instructions and resources on how to get it.
4. Create a new branch for your script.
5. Open a pull request describing your script, what it is for, and how it works, adding at least two reviewers.

### Improving existing script

For constant improvement and support of available scripts, anyone can inspect and suggest hot fixes or features. To do so, a similar workflow is followed, where you must create a new branch with the following name pattern:

```script_name/type/branch_name```

Here, **type** can be something like *feature*, *hotfix*, *bugfix*, etc.
