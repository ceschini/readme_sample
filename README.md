# Sample README File

This project should hold a template on how to create a simple and functional README file. This first paragraph should introduce the project, describing what it does and how it does it.

## Installation

Here should be transcribed the steps required to install the project, specifying requirements and how to supply them. An example of a python project installation follows:

```python3
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Even though it can be installed in the global python environment, it is prefferable to install it in a virtual environment as follows:

1. Install ```virtualenv``` if you don't already have it.

    ```pip install virtualenv```

2. Create a new virtual environment via the ```virtualenv``` package.

```virtualenv .venv```

3.Install python packages requirements.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage

Here should be detailed the steps required to run and use the scripts found on this project. Instructions should be provided to run it on different settings and with all the available parameters, describing each one of them. An example of a python script usage is as follows:

```bash
python example.py <foo> <bar> <params>
```

In order to run, please take notice of the three positional parameters.

* **foo**: does something.
* **bar**: does something else
* **params**: also does something else.
